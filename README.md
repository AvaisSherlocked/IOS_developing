Purpose and primary features
Our app named “CouponGo”, aims to making the business activity of spreading coupons with AR techniques, which replaces common paper coupon with digital coupon and makes the process of getting coupon has more fun.
This app has its initial two purposes, one is to make coupon more useful, since we often get coupons when we don’t need, and next time when we want to use it we cannot find it. This app stores digital coupons for users, in addition, it makes user to grab coupon nearby the restaurant, thus user can use coupons immediately after grabbed it. Another purpose is to allow the process of getting coupons with more fun, and also promote users to go out to grab coupon when he/she is near the restaurant, which makes them more likely to use coupon and make assumption at restaurant.
Primary features:
1. Show map at user’s location, and show both restaurant and coupon labels on the map. (GoogleAPI, YelpAPI).
2. Show a camera view when user wants to grab the coupon, and put the 3D coupon at a random spatial position, only when user (with iphone) comes to the nearby of this coupon (within the distane of 1 meter) can he/she get that coupon.
